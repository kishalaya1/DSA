# DSA
This is my personal project for Data Structures and Algorithms in C#.This contains many common algorthms implemented in C#.
The list of algorithms and problems are as follows:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Remove duplicate characters from string
3. Check if two words are anagrams
4. Check if a word is a palindrome 
5. Check if a word has unique characters - Heterogram 
6. Get all substrings from a word
7. Generate all factors of a number 
8. HCF(Highest common factor) of an array of numbers
9. LCM(Least common multiple) of an array of numbers 
10. Armstrong number 

The list of special algortihms are as follows:
